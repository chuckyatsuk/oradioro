I'm building a luxury vacation rental website for Villa 156, a high-end property in Cura√ßao. The site should have the sophisticated, minimal aesthetic of luxury hotel brands like Aman Resorts and Six Senses.

Reference sites for design inspiration:
- https://www.aman.com
- https://www.sixsenses.com
- Look at their clean typography, elegant white space, and how they showcase properties

Current setup: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and Shadcn/ui components.

Please create:

1. A sophisticated homepage with:
    - Full-screen hero image with elegant overlay text
    - Clean navigation (Home, Villa, Location, Amenities, Gallery, Contact)
    - Smooth scroll animations using Framer Motion
    - Refined typography using a luxury-appropriate font

2. Basic page structure for:
    - Villa details page (rooms, amenities)
    - Location page (area info, attractions)
    - Gallery page (image showcase)
    - Contact page (inquiry form)

Design principles:
- Minimal, luxury hotel aesthetic like the reference sites
- Lots of white space
- Elegant animations on scroll
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Focus on imagery and experience over features

Use placeholder content for now - we'll add real content later. Prioritize the visual hierarchy and sophisticated feel over functionality at this stage.
